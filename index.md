I have been a Professor in [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/) at [Shandong University](http://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/) since July 2020. Before that, I was a postdoc at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) in Stockholm from March 2018 to May 2020, working majorly with professor [Martin Monperrus](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/). Even before that, I worked as a postdoc in [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) from August 2016 to February 2018, working majorly with professor [Lionel Seinturier](http://chercheurs.lille.inria.fr/~seinturi/) and professor [Martin Monperrus](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/). I received both my Bachelor and Doctorate degrees from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China (previously known as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics).



My general research interests are in programming language, software engineering, and formal methods. My current research program has a particular focus on the areas of [program synthesis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/program_synthesis_now.pdf), [program verification](https://cse.usf.edu/~haozheng/lib/verification/general/survey-sw-fv.pdf), [program repair](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01206501/file/survey-automatic-repair.pdf), and empirical study (in particular of programming language features), and the research goal is to make programming easier and programs more robust.



<b>I am actively looking for self-motivated and talented students at different levels (PhD students, post-docs, master students, undergratuate students) to join my research group, students that are good at programming and(or) enjoy working on the formal side of programming are especially welcome.</b> If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to drop me an email (zhongxing.yu@sdu.edu.cn).
