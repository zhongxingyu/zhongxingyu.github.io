I have been a Qilu Young Professor (“齐鲁青年学者”特聘教授) in [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/) at [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.cn/) Shandong University since July 2020. Before that, I was a postdoc in the [Theoretical Computer Science Group](https://www.kth.se/tcs) at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) in Stockholm since from March 2018 to May 2020, working majorly with professor [Martin Monperrus](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/) and professor [Benoit Baudry](https://softwarediversity.eu/). Even before that, I worked as a postdoc in [Inria Lille - Nord Europe](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/lille) from August 2016 to February 2018, working majorly with professor [Lionel Seinturier](http://chercheurs.lille.inria.fr/~seinturi/) and professor [Martin Monperrus](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/). I received both my Bachelor and Doctorate degrees from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China (previously known as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics).



My general research interests are in programming language, software engineering, and machine learning, in particular I am excited about working at the intersection between them. My current research program has a particular focus on the areas of [program synthesis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/program_synthesis_now.pdf) and [program repair](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01206501/file/survey-automatic-repair.pdf), and the research goal is to make programming easier and programs more robust.



I am actively looking for self-motivated and talented students at different levels (PhD students, post-docs, master students, undergratuate students) to join my research group, students that are good at programming and(or) enjoy working on the formal side of programming are especially welcome. We aim at tackling crucial, pressing, difficult problems via principled, elegant, practical solutions. Our work strives for not only publishing in the best venues, but more importantly for achieving elegance and impact, both conceptual and practical. If you are interested, please feel free to drop me an email (zhongxing.yu@sdu.edu.cn).
